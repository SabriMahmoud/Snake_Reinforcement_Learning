# Snake_Reinforcement_Learning

I'm Currently 🔭 working  on this project for now this snake maximum score is 76 in 1000 iteration .
I accept all suggestions don't be shy !!

PS : I followed this Youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXgNpp0jedKWcQiULLbDTA) of Python Engineer that uses a Bellman Equation (Q_learning ) 
 and I'm searching for new ways to upgrade the algorithme .
